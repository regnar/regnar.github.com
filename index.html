    "Desert Regnars are a small blind reptilian species which can be found in the Mekar Wilderness of Cardassia. They have an impressive facility for camouflage which is enhanced by their consistently calm demeanour, they only move when the wind or shadow can conceal their displacement and use a chameleon like ability to blend into the surroundings making them nearly invisible." ~ <a href="http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Regnar">Memory Beta</a>
